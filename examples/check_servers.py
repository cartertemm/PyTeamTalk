"""Simple TeamTalk bot that summarizes users on a collection of TeamTalk
servers and promptly logs out. This was meant to address a concern from many
administrators that felt uncomfortable with a program continuously intercepting
events. There was a similar service offered by Chris Nestrud a couple years
back, but to my knowledge it no longer exists.

This example is slightly more involved, as it implements quick configuration handling and thread pooling."""
